# Jupyter Notebooks
This folder contains my projects, which were inspired by Kaggle and their courses/notebooks.

### Ames Housing Dataset
After completing a course on Kaggle I decided to enter the competition and submit my results. The first Notebook's purpose is visualisation, me trying out Seaborn and the second Notebook contains the predictive model.

### Web Scraping from arxiv.org
This Jupyter Notebook was a way for me to learn more about web scraping in Python and also try our some new visualization techniques. I chose the website arxiv.org, since it has lots of info and I could work with the html behind it easily.

I decided to learn more about protoplanetary disks (namely HD 163296), a topic I wrote my Bachelor's thesis about and see whats trending :)
