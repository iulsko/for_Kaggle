# Jupyter Notebooks
This folder contains my projects, which were inspired by Kaggle and their courses/notebooks.

### Ames Housing Dataset
After completing a course on Kaggle I decided to enter the competition and submit my results. The first Notebook's purpose is visualisation, me trying out Seaborn and the second Notebook contains the predictive model.

### Web Scraping from arxiv.org
This Jupyter Notebook was a way for me to learn more about web scraping in Python and also try our some new visualization techniques. I chose the website arxiv.org, since it has lots of info and I could work with the html behind it easily.

I decided to learn more about protoplanetary disks (namely HD 163296), a topic I wrote my Bachelor's thesis about and see whats trending :)

### Budgeting
There I have a simple tool, which analyses my monthly spendings and visualises them. I also included the txt-files with dummy data. Since I have also learned some HTML and CSS recently, I decided to make a small web-page containing the graphs and explaining the details of my analysis. 

### NLP
This folder currently contains the contents of the NLP course by Kaggle (where you fill in the missing code).
