      "I'm not one to write a bad review, I usually just don't go back. But I've lived in vegas for 5 years, being from New Jersey I've eaten the best in Jersey and All the 5 boroughs in New York. And believe me between Vegas and Henderson there are some really excellent italian restaurants....I'm 100% italian and in the food business. So I know what food should taste, look, smell like....First off I've passed this joint 100 times...always said one day I'll give it a shot...so the other night I did....my foodie partner and I walk in...first I think wow this joint is gonna be great...just by the ambiance of kinda vintage ol' school Vegas...so I give it and 8 for appearance....not clean or organized at all but that doesn't mean it's gonna be a bad joint...now we sit down and we are given Red wine on the house with little tasting glasses which I loved...thought man this joint is going on my list...ok skip ahead to the menu on the wall...yeah u read that right....there's a huge ass menu on the wall with the normal shit on it...MEATBALLS, SPAGHETTI, CHICKEN PARM, EGGPLANT PARM, u get the idea....ok no big deal this is what this guy offers, ok so be it. Now for the prices? And I ain't cheap by any means, this place is a joke...but we order anyway thinking small menu, high prices he has to use top of the line products...yeah not so much...I order eggplant Parm with a side of Meatballs...my buddy ordered chicken rio, ok so now the garlic bread comes along with my complimentary salad and his soup, he said the soup was average and my salad was good, crispy romaine sliced Mozzarella not fresh but restaurant depot or Sysco crap...ok no big deal...now 7 min after ordering our food comes out...yes i time the order to the time I'm served....RED Flag...right away...no way that's cooked to order...it came out my gravy tasted like pure sugar and dark...which means he uses a shit tomato and that gravy has been cooking all day down to a thick transmission fluid like state...and full of oil..the Meatballs were hard as rocks, means he only uses a shit beef in them and then bakes them off which is ok if u use the right mix...they where dead to me not soft and firm like a good Meatball should be and tasteless no garlic or fresh Grated Parm Regg in them just BLAH...my eggplant itself was ok...but the gravy ruined the taste for me...my buddies chicken rio was dry and bland and fell apart which means it was made earlier in the day and sat in a cold drawer and just put in a pan with that cream sauce over rottini macaroni.....awful to serve that shit....take pride in your food...\n",
      "Now we decided to order a slice of taramisu ok store bought shit or made last Monday it was sour and smelt like what ever fridge it was in....and the complimentary \"cappuccino \" was that Swiss miss hot chocolate and cappuccino mix...with a shit load of whip cream on it..actually best part of the meal....this joint sucks...this ain't italian food....save yourself the trip....will I be back....only against my will....sorry guys if u read this...take some pride in your food and taste it before it leaves the kitchen.\n"
