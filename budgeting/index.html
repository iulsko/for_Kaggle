        <h2 class="explanation">How I track my monthly spending</h2>
        <p>
          Every month I create a new Notes file on my phone where I write down everything I have spent money on. If it's in the 'Other' category I usually right a short description for it. So, currently I have these categories:
          <ul>
            <li>Groceries</li>
            <li>Clothes</li>
            <li>Beauty <i>(moisturizer, body cream, nail polish etc.)</i></li>
            <li>Eating Out <i>(at work, on campus, with friends)</i></li>
            <li>Other</li>
          </ul>
          I have created a Jupyter Notebook, where I have written a simple code to plot a pie-chart of my expenses <i>(since my rent and insurance has been the same for over 3 months, I just add it to my expenses directly in the Notebook)</i>. I also visualize how my total spending is developing over time with a bar chart.

        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>Now, I am not going to upload the real charts here. After all, no one needs to know how much I spend on moisturizer and sunscreen. So, these graphs were done using dummy numbers.</p>

        <p>In the bar chart below I see that in October I spent way too much money <i>(and that's because I was moving cities)</i>.</p>
